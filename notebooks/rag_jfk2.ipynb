    "In this post, I will continue from where my [last post](http://michael-harmon.com/blog/ragjfk1.html) left off. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my past post I discussed how to ingest President Kennedy's speeches into [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) vector database and perform semantic search both using Pinecone's API as well as using [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/). I used Pinecone for a vector database since its clloud based, fully managed and of course has a free tier. In this post I will expand upon this work and build out a [Retrivial Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) pipeline using Langchain to be able to answer questions on President Kennedy's speeches. Finally, I'll be deploying this out as a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app for users to try out! As part of this last step I'll build out a [continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipeline. This last component is tricky as RAG systms, like any application that uses a [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) are notorious for being difficult to test in a robust and reproducible fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask whats the point of RAG pipelines, don't LLMs know all the answers? The answer is most LLMs take a long time to train and are often trained on data that is out of date when people begin to use it. In order to incorporate more recent data into our LLM we could use fine-tuning, but this can still be time confusing and costly. The other option is to use RAG, which takes your original question, embeds as a vector and \"retrieves\" documents from a vector database. These documents are the ones that are most semantically related to the question. The original question and the retrieved documents are passed into a prompt which is fed into the LLM. The prompt will contain you question and use the documents as \"context\" to generate an answer. The entire process is depicted below,\n",

His grim warnings about the future of the world, his aide memoire on Berlin, his subsequent speeches and threats which he and his agents have launched, and the increase in the Soviet military budget that he has announced, have all prompted a series of decisions by the Administration and a series of consultations with the members of the NATO organization. In Berlin, as you recall, he intends to bring to an end, through a stroke of the pen, first our legal rights to be in West Berlin --and secondly our ability to make good on our commitment to the two million free people of that city. That we cannot permit.\\nWe are clear about what must be done--and we intend to do it. I want to talk frankly with you tonight about the first steps that we shall take. These actions will require sacrifice on the part of many of our citizens. More will be required in the future. They will require, from all of us, courage and perseverance in the years to come. But if we and our allies act out of strength and unity of purpose--with calm determination and steady nerves--using restraint in our words as well as our weapons--I am hopeful that both peace and freedom will be sustained.\\nThe immediate threat to free men is in West Berlin. But that isolated outpost is not an isolated problem. The threat is worldwide. Our effort must be equally wide and strong, and not be obsessed by any single manufactured crisis. We face a challenge in Berlin, but there is also a challenge in Southeast Asia, where the borders are less guarded, the enemy harder to find, and the dangers of communism less apparent to those who have so little. We face a challenge in our own hemisphere, and indeed wherever else the freedom of human beings is at stake.'),\n",
